          it a bunch more later, but in essence, this
          means that we write tests for our code before actually writing any code.",

          of tests.",
      "4. You'll be running tests using the RSpec framework, watching them fail, and
          then making them pass. It's going to be a ton of fun!",
      "5. Usually you'll make the tests pass by actually writing code, but in this case
          you'll be exploring Ruby by altering the tests themselves.",

          run the tests again, see slightly less errors and repeat.",
